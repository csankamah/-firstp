    <h1>COUSCOUS</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/couscous.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Couscous is a tiny pasta made of wheat or barley.
         Although couscous was traditionally hand-rolled, these days it's made by machine: Coarsely-ground durum wheat (semolina) is moistened and tossed with fine wheat flour until it forms tiny, round balls.</p>
